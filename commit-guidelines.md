# Commit Guidelines

We like commits to be clear, concise and easy to review. Please follow the following rules:

- Keep commits small, clear and specific
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move file to..." not "Moves file to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Do not reference issues/pull requests in commit messages

If you are having trouble writing a succinct commit message, or if it includes the word 'and', consider splitting the commit into smaller ones.

## Emoji Styleguide
